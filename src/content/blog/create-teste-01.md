Image Type: Photorealistic. We want this to look as crisp and clear as your website should be after following these tips.



Setting: A minimalist, modern office space. Think clean lines, lots of whites and greys â€“ a space that breathes 'efficiency'.



Main Subjects: A sleek laptop with a cluttered website on the screen juxtaposed against a simplified version of the same website. This visual contrast will instantly convey your message.



Text Placement & Style: The text '13 Must-Drop Elements' in bold, white letters, perhaps in the upper third of the image. Concise, punchy, and attention-grabbing, aligning with the rule of thirds for aesthetic appeal.



Overall Mood: Professional yet approachable. We're aiming for a vibe that says, "Trust us, your website needs this."
